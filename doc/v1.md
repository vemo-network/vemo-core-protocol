### Project Overview
Vemo is a DeFi protocol designed to tokenize locked positions into dynamic NFTs with on-chain balances and built-in release schedules, known as smart vouchers. Smart voucher holders enjoy the freedom to claim their tokens according to the preset release schedule, all without requiring external authorization. Remarkably, the voucher market operates autonomously from the spot market, ensuring that trading vouchers has no impact on the spot price of the underlying token. This innovative approach fosters a decentralized ecosystem where locked positions are seamlessly transformed into tradable assets. This unlocks new possibilities for liquidity provision and financial flexibility in order to revolutionize the DeFi landscape to the next level.  

The core framework of Vemo in version 1 revolves around two key contracts: Voucher.sol and ERC6551Account.sol
* Voucher Contract: This contract functions as the manager for both the NFT collection and the associated token-bound accounts. It empowers users to create voucher collections and acts as a gateway for creating ERC6551Account.
* ERC6551Account Contract: This contract is responsible for holding the token assets. Each ERC6551Account (token-bound account) maintains a one-to-one linkage with an ERC721 token (NFT). The contract utilizes mechanisms that allow for claiming rewards over a fixed period or on a linear schedule (hours, days, or months). This implementation enables the trading of vesting positions through ERC721 ownership while upholding the vesting logic.

Moreover, Vemo is designed with scalability in mind. It can accommodate locked positions from diverse sources, such as staking as well as possess the flexibility to adapt to various business logics, with the potential for future expansion planned in version 2.

File Name | Description
-- | --
Voucher.sol | The code defines a smart contract, Voucher, responsible for managing the distribution of both NFT tokens and their token-bound accounts (in the form of ERC6551Account) to manage vesting positions. Additionally, it functions as a portal, allowing users to create NFT:ERC6551Account pairs in batches, specify vesting schedules, and request common information.
AccountRegistry.sol | The code defines the AccountRegistry contract, which functions as a factory for ERC6551Account. This contract allows for the creation and retrieval of token-bound accounts for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using the CREATE2 opcode. This contract serves as a registry for token-bound accounts associated with NFTs, providing functionalities for their deterministic creation and retrieval.
ERC6551Account.sol | The code defines the ERC6551Account contract. This contract is designed to hold token assets on behalf of users, while simultaneously delegating ownership of those assets to the corresponding NFT owner. The NFT owner can claim the vesting tokens through either the Voucher contract or directly through the ERC6551Account contract itself.
VemoVestingPoolFactory.sol | The code defines the VemoVestingPoolFactory contract. This contract functions as a factory for creating and managing VemoVestingPool contracts. It provides a standardized and efficient approach for deploying and interacting with token vesting schedules within decentralized applications.
VestingPool.sol | The code defines the VestingPool contract. This contract is responsible for managing token vesting schedules and facilitating the purchase and distribution of tokens according to pre-defined rules. It incorporates functionalities such as whitelist verification, fee calculations, and offering flexible allocation options.

### Sequence Diagram Overview
1. Token Holder: Initiator of token-related actions, including locking them in vesting schemes and minting vouchers.
2. Vesting Pool Factory: This contract facilitates the creation of Vesting Pools with defined vesting schedules and terms.
3. Vesting Pool: Stores the principle tokens and establishes the conditions for participation in the pool.
4. Voucher: This contract mints vouchers and NFTs based on the input vesting schedule and principle  amount.
5. ERC6551Account: An account or entity represents a minted voucher linked to an NFT.
6. Pool Participants: Entities eligible to participate in vesting pools by offering exchange tokens for minted vouchers.


This sequence depicts the flow of tokens from their initial locking to post-vesting redemption. It encompasses the minting of vouchers and NFTs, as well as the participation of pool participants within the vesting process.

#### Create voucher

- **createBatch**: Allows an user to batch mint vouchers with principle tokens, multiple vesting schemes.
```
function createBatch(address tokenAddress, BatchVesting memory batch, uint96 royaltyRate) public nonReentrant returns (address, uint256, uint256) {}
```
- **create**: Allows an user to mint a voucher with principle tokens, multiple vesting schemes.
```
function create(address tokenAddress, Vesting memory vesting) external returns (address nftAddress, uint256 tokenId){}
```
#### Redeem voucher

- **Voucher.redeem**: This function executes a vesting process for the voucher owner, with Voucher acting as the portal.
```
function redeem(address nftAddress, uint256 tokenId, uint256 _amount) external returns (bool) {}
```
- **ERC6551Account.redeem**: This function performs the vesting process directly on the voucher account, as initiated by the voucher owner.
```
function redeem(uint256 amount) external{}
```

### Data structure
- **Voucher input structure**:
```
struct VestingSchedule {
    uint256 amount;
    uint8 vestingType; // linear: 1 | staged: 2
    uint8 linearType; // day: 1 | week: 2 | month: 3 | quarter: 4
    uint256 startTimestamp;
    uint256 endTimestamp;
    uint8 isVested; // unvested: 0 | vested : 1 | vesting : 2
    uint256 remainingAmount;
}

struct VestingFee {
    uint8 isFee; // no-fee: 0 | fee : 1
    address feeTokenAddress;
    address receiverAddress;
    uint256 totalFee;
    uint256 remainingFee;
}

struct Vesting {
    uint256 balance;
    VestingSchedule[] schedules;
    VestingFee fee;
}

struct BatchVesting {
    Vesting vesting;
    uint256 quantity;
    string[] tokenUris;
}
```
### Events
- **VoucherCreated**: Emitted when a voucher is created.
```
event VoucherCreated(
        address indexed account,
        address indexed currency,
        uint256 amount,
        address indexed nftCollection,
        uint256 tokenId
    );
```
- **Voucher aka Token bound account**: TBA is a comprehensive entity that encompasses the vesting schedule and locked tokens, in addition to implementing the business logic. Furthermore, each TBA is linked to an NFT featuring a structured metadata format
```
{
    name:	"Smart Voucher #0",
    description:	"smart voucher description",
    image:	"ipfs_link",
}
```

- **VoucherRedeem**: Signals when a partial or full amount of vesting tokens is claimed from the voucher.
```
 event VoucherRedeem(
        address indexed account,
        address indexed currency,
        uint256 claimedAmount,
        address indexed nftCollection,
        uint256 tokenId
    );
```

### Example

```
    uint256 feeAmount = Math.mulDiv(amount, _fee.totalFee, _token0Amount, Math.Rounding.Floor);

    IVoucher.VestingFee memory voucherFee = IVoucher.VestingFee(
        _fee.isFee,
        _fee.feeTokenAddress,
        _fee.receiverAddress,
        feeAmount,
        0
    );

    IVoucher.VestingSchedule[] memory schedules = new IVoucher.VestingSchedule[](_vestingSchedules.length);

    uint256 scheduleLength = _vestingSchedules.length;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < scheduleLength; i++) {
        uint256 vestingAmount = Math.mulDiv(amount, _vestingSchedules[i].amount, _token0Amount, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        IVoucher.VestingSchedule memory schedule = IVoucher.VestingSchedule(
            vestingAmount,
            _vestingSchedules[i].vestingType,
            _vestingSchedules[i].linearType,
            _vestingSchedules[i].startTimestamp,
            _vestingSchedules[i].endTimestamp,
            _vestingSchedules[i].isVested,
            vestingAmount
        );

        schedules[i] = schedule;
    }

    IVoucher.Vesting memory params = IVoucher.Vesting(
        amount,
        schedules,
        voucherFee
    );

    string[] memory tokenUris = new string[](1);
    tokenUris[0] = string.concat(_baseUrl, tokenUri);
    IVoucher.BatchVesting memory batchVesting = IVoucher.BatchVesting(
        params,
        1,
        tokenUris
    );

    IERC20(_token0).approve(address(_vemoVoucher), amount);
    
    (address voucher, uint256 startId, uint256 endId) = _vemoVoucher.createBatch(_token0, batchVesting, _royaltyRate);

    for (uint256 i = startId; i <= endId; i++)
        ERC721(voucher).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, i);
```
